      <h3>Analogy:</h3>
      <h4 > When eating cereal size of bowl, amount of milk, and amount of cereal matters </h4>
      <h4 > A narrow bowl can leave cereal dry at the top, too much milk will make the cereal<br> soggy, and too little cereal will leave the bowl feeling empty and unfulfilling. Only<br> a perfect balance of everything makes a perfect breakfast delight!
