    <h3 style="text-align: left; transform: translateX(460px); max-width: 800px;"> These three components DEPEND on each other; you need to tune<br> each of these based on the environment and photo you want to create. </h3>

    <h3>Analogy:</h3>
    <h4 style="text-align: left; transform: translateX(460px); max-width: 800px;"> Just like a car, one can adjust their speed, four wheel drive setting, and music<br> based on the environment. </h4>
    <h4 style="text-align: left; transform: translateX(460px); max-width: 800px;"> If one is driving on dirt and mud in a forest, four wheel drive (FWD) has to be on. <br>FWD has a max speed of 30MPH,
         but the music can be played at any volume<br> because no one is around to get pissed off</h4>
