                <p>ISO is the camera's sensitivity to light. Higher ISO values
                    increase sensitivity,
                    useful for low-light situations but may introduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_noise" target="_blank">noise</a>.

                <p>How open the lens is, which controls how much light enters the camera.
                    It is measured in f-stops (f/1.8, f/4, f/11). A wider aperture (lower f-stop) lets in more light and creates a shallower depth of field, often resulting in a blurred background, which is ideal for portraits. A narrower aperture (higher f-stop) lets in less light but keeps more of the scene in focus, which is great for landscapes and architectural photos.

            <div class="boxThreeBottom">
                <p>The length the shutter stays open when the shutter button is clicked (Similar to how eyes open and close for a certein amount of time). It is measured in seconds (1/1000s, 1/250s, 1s). A fast shutter speed (e.g., 1/1000s) captures quick movements sharply, which is useful for action shots or bright conditions. A slow shutter speed (e.g., 1/30s or slower) allows more light to enter and can create motion blur, which is effective for low-light photography or creating effects like light trails.
